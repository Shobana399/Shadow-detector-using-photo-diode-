A mini project to detect shadow using photodiode and transistors
# Shadow Detector using Photodiode

## Overview
This is a simple hardware-based mini project built using basic electronic components. It detects the presence of a **shadow** using a photodiode and turns ON an LED when light is blocked. This project demonstrates the use of a light sensor and transistor switching.

## Components Used
- Photodiode (reverse biased)
- 2 × BC547 NPN Transistors
- 1 × LED
- 3 × Resistors (values as per circuit)
- 9V Battery
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Working Principle
- The **photodiode** is connected in **reverse bias** so it responds to light.
- In the presence of light, current flows through the photodiode and keeps the transistor OFF.
- When a **shadow falls**, the current drops, triggering the transistor switch and turning **ON the LED**.
- A second transistor helps improve switching and stability.

## What I Learned
- How photodiodes work in sensing applications
- Role of **transistors as electronic switches**
- Use of resistors for biasing and protection
- Building circuits without any microcontroller or code

## How to Build
1. Connect the photodiode in reverse bias to the base of the first transistor.
2. Use appropriate resistors for current limiting and biasing.
3. Link the collector of the second transistor to the LED.
4. Power the circuit using a 9V battery.
5. Observe the LED turning ON when a shadow blocks the light falling on the photodiode.

## Project Status
- Completed  
- No programming or software involved  
- Purely hardware and sensor-based
